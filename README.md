# Hi, welcome to my GitHub

## About Me
I am a third year engineering student at the [University of British Columbia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_British_Columbia) studying Mechanical Engineering 
with a specialization in **Mechatronics**. I am looking for a Co-Op opportunities starting **May 2024**!

## My Interests
I have a variety of intersts ranging from programming microcontrollers and swimming. My primary engineering interests include embedded systems, electronics, a bit of controls and machine design. 

## My Projects So Far
So far I tackled interesting projects ranging from Collaborative Robotics, mechanical design, and a bit of embedded software. I hope to expand on my home automation projects by making custom electronic circuits, and learning to write high quality and professional code!

### Circular Buffer Library for Platform IO
From my Co-Op I learned how cicular buffers are a useful data structure for embedded systems! So I wrote a library that I can download and use on Platform IO. [Link](https://github.com/AndyMWK/circular-buffer-lib-for-pio)

### Home Automation - Lighting
I worked on a lighting home automation project where used two ESP32 Dev Boards and two servo motors to turn a room light switch on and off. I am learning freeRTOS right now to implement robust and even richer functions. [Link](https://github.com/AndyMWK/Home-Automation---Lighting)

### Automated Pet Food Dispenser
After my first year of engineering, I made a dispensing machine that automatically dispenses pet food. [Link](https://github.com/AndyMWK/Automated-Pet-Food-Dispenser)

## What I am Up To Currently
I am working on a Remote Rocket Iginition System at my design team, [UBC Rocket](https://www.ubcrocket.com/). Aside from that I am currently looking for some interesting projects to pursue!
